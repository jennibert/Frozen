        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>Olaf is known to be a friendly snowman who was made from Elsa's powers during her Let It Go segment. Olaf resembles the snownman made during Elsa and Anna's childhood flashback. He met Anna along her journey to reunite with her sister and bring her back to Adelaide. He helped Anna along the way, always having a positive attitude. He often expressed how much he loved summer but never experienced it due to being a snowman. Once, Elsa returned to Adelaide she was able to make a cloud float above Olaf's head so he could survive when he is not in a cold environment including summer.
