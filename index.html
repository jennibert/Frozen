    <h3> Biography</h3> 
        <p>Elsa is the first princess and heir of Adelaide who manifested magical ice powers. As a child, she often showed off her power until one day she accidentally hurt her sister, Anna. Since then she hid her powers from everyone including her sister, whose memory was erased from magical beings known as trolls. The trolls warned her and her parents that she would eventually lose control of her powers so out of fear she isolated herself even after the death of her parents. During her inauguration, Elsa loses control of her powers and freezes the entire Adelaide kingdom before she runs off to the mountains. Her sister, Anna was eventually able to convince Elsa to come back and fix everything. However, in the second movie, Elsa starts to her voices or spirits telling her to run into the forest where she finds out the origin of her powers.
